Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is a major branch of computer science where by it deals with designing,developing,testing and maintaining software applications.Software engineers apply engineering principals of programming languages to solve solutions.Programming is entirely centered on around the code,software engineering is extended over the software life cycle which is maintenance,structure and methodical approach to software development.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
 
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Software development life cycle is a structured process used to develop,test ana maintain software applications.The phases are:
a)Requirement gathering
Involves identifying and documenting the needs and expectations of the software's end users.
b)Design
The softwares architecture and high level design are defined.This includes creating detailed diagrams and specifications that outline how the software will be developed and how it will function.
c)Testing
Testing is a crucial phase where the software is evaluated for its functionability,reliability and perfomance.This phase involves identifying and fixing any bugs and issues that arise during testing.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
In comparing agile and waterfall models,the waterfall model is linear and sequential,making it easy to manage but inflexible to changes once a phase is completed.It involves extensive documentation and has limited ability to accomodate changes mid project,posing higher risks if requirements change.In contrast the agile model is iterative and incremental,breaking projects into small manageable units called sprints which allows for continous feedback and improvement.Agile emphasizes collaboration,flexibility and continous customer involvement,reducing risk through frequent testing and iteration.While waterfall is suited for projects with well defined requirements
Requirements Engineering.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering involves defining,documenting and maintaining requirements throughout the engineering design process.The processes are;
a)Requirement elicitation.
IT deals with gathering requirements from stake holders through interviews,surveys and observations.
b)Requirement analysis
Refining gathered requirements to ensure they are complete,clear and .feasible.
c)Requirement specification
Documenting requirements in a formal document,such as software requirement specification.
Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design refers to the practise of breaking down a software system into smaller,independent and reusable components or module.
How modularity improves maintanability and scalability of software systems.
a)Easier debugging and trouble shooting;With modularity developers can isolate and debug specific modules or components without affecting the entire software system.
b)Improved reusability;Modularity allows for the re use of existing modules in different software systems or projects.This reduces the time and effort required for developing new software and promotes code sharing and reuse.
c)Enhanced flexibility and adaptability;Modularity enables software systems or projects to be more flexible and adaptable to changing requirements or technology.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing-Testing individual components or modules in isolation to verify their correctness.
Integration testing-Testing the interaction between integrated modules to ensure they work together as expected.
System testing-Testing the complete system a a whole to validate its compliance with the specified requirement.
Acceptance testing-Testing conducted by end users to determine whether the software mets their needs and is ready for deployment.
Importance of testing.
a)Defect identification-Helps identify and fix bugs early in the development process.
b)Quality assurance-Ensures the software meets specified requirements and perform as expected
c)Risk mitigation-Reduces the risk of software failure in production by catching issues beforehand.
d)User satisfaction-Leads to more reliable and user friendly products enhancing customer satisfaction.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version controlled systems are tools used to manage and track changes to source codes over time.They enable multiple developers to collaborate on a project simultaneously without conflict.
Example;git ,subversion,mercurial.
Features of git.
-Distributed version control,branching and merging lightweight tags.
Features of subversion.
-Centralized version control,atomic commits,directory versioning,support for binary files.
Features of mercurial.
-Distributed version control,lightweight branching,extensibility with plug ins,high perfomance.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects
Roles of a software project manager.
-Responsible for overseeing and coordinating all aspects of a software development project.
-Ensuring that the project is completed on time within budget and meets the required quality standards.
Key responsibilities.
-Project planning
Define project scope,objectives and deliverables.
Develop detailed project plans including timelines and milestones.
-Resource management.
Allocate task and resources to team members effectively.
Manage the project team including developers,testers and other stake holders.
-Budget management.
Ensure the project stays within the allocated budget.
Track expenses and manage project finances.
Challenges faced.
-Scope creep;Managing changes in project scope and ensuring they do not derail the project.
-Risk management;Identifying and mitigating potential risk that could impact the project sucess.
-Stakeholder communication;Keeping all stakeholders informed and managing their expectations.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle
Software maintenance refers to the porocess of modifying a software product after it has been delivered to correct faults,improved performance or adapt each to changes in the environment.
Types of maintenance activities
a}Corrective maintenance
Involves fixing bugs and defects discovered after the software has been deployed.
b}Adaptive maintenance
adjust the software to work in a new or changed environment.
c}Perfective maintenance 
enhances or improves the software to add new features or improves performance.
d}Preventive maintenance
Refactures and optimises the code to prevent potential future issues and improve maintainability.
Importance od software maintenance
a}longivity
Ensures that software remains operational and useful over its intended lifespan.
b}Cost effectiveness
Can be more cost effective than developing new software.
c}User satisfaction
Addresses user needs and feedback,enhancing user experience.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues faced by software engineers
a}Privacy;ensuring that user data is protected and used appropriately.
b}Security;developing secure software and protecting against cyber threats.
c}Bias;ensuaring that software does not discriminate against individuals or groups.
How software engineers can adhere to the ethical standards
a}Education;staying informed about ethical issues and best practises in software engineering.
b}Code of ethics;following a professional code of ethics.
c}Continous improvement;continously evaluating and improving their ethical decision making processes.
